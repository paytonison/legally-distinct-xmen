## Summary
The story opens with Simon, a young man with regenerative abilities who has been imprisoned and subjected to brutal medical experimentation for years in a secure facility. Despite dying repeatedly from torture and tests, Simon cannot stay dead and has become deeply jaded, using dark humor and self-mutilation as coping mechanisms. During one such episode, Simon stages a fake death experience, complete with theatrical dialogue and self-inflicted injuries, to manipulate the lab staff into panic. Later, while recovering from another near-death event, he discovers that intruders have planted a bomb near his window, mistakenly believing the room is empty. He survives the explosion, escapes his restraints, and begins plotting his way out—planning to retrieve his prosthetic arm and flee the facility.

The narrative then shifts to Valarie Jones, a newly appointed representative of the nation of Aether. Set in a politically fragmented world divided into multiple regions (including Mors, Talura, and the Southern Wildlands), Valarie’s job is to help oversee interviews for future national leaders. During the interview process, she becomes intrigued by a candidate: the daughter of a war criminal named Hayoto Himura, leader of the Empirical Militia, which is responsible for ongoing riots and unrest. The daughter claims she is fleeing her father and wants to become a leader to prevent others from experiencing the kind of violence she endured. Valarie, sensing the girl’s sincerity and potential strategic value, orders that her application be preserved and flagged for further review.

Valarie is then summoned by Council Member Hagen, a high-ranking official with significant political influence. In a private meeting, Hagen reveals a secret mission: a boy imprisoned and experimented on in the Southern Wildlands is believed to be the key to ending the national unrest. Valarie is instructed to lead a small, covert operation to retrieve him, interview him, and potentially elevate him to a leadership position if he proves worthy. The chapter ends with Hagen revealing the boy’s name—**Simon**—bringing the two threads of the story into direct connection.

The story combines dystopian science fiction with political intrigue and elements of dark humor, establishing dual protagonists on converging paths within a fragmented world of authoritarian oversight, bioengineering, and rebellion.
